# pacmen
Factory for making pacmen

You are given a starter.html code.
When button "make one" is pressed you need to complete the code 
to position the new pacman image and add it to the "game" div. It is then added to the array of pacmen, which keeps track of the position and velocity of each pacman.
You also need to make each pacman bounce off any wall it hits.
Finally, alternate between images to make the pacmen open and close their mouth
Start by getting at least one pacman positioned and viewable. 


Run:
copy index.html and pacmen.js into the same folder. Either drag index.html into the browser or right click and select open with using your preferred browser.
